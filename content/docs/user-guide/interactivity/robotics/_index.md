description: Learn how to create robotics simulation in Open 3D Engine (O3DE) with ROS 2.
---

O3DE supports simulation for robotics through a dedicated ROS 2 Gem (as well as additional Gems extending it).

There are components for simulation of sensors, robot control and steering, manipulator arms, and importing robots from common format.
